## Intro
GlucoStatusFX is a JavaFX application that will sit in your menu bar and is visualizing
data coming from a nightscout server.
To use this app you need to have a nightscout server which url you have to put in the
text field in the settings dialog.
In the settings dialog you can will find the following parameters:

<b>"Unit mg/dl":</b><br>
Whatever unit you have defined on your nightscout server you can change the display to either mg/dl or mmol/l. In case you would like to see the values in mg/dl, please enable the switch "Unit mg/dl". If you disable this switch the values will be shown in mmol/l.

<b>"Low value notification":</b><br>
Enable the switch if you would like to receive notifications for low values (in GlucoStatusFX acceptable low means values between min acceptable and 55 mg/dl which is min critical).

<b>"Acceptable low value notification":</b><br>
Enable the switch if you would like to receive notifications for acceptable low values (in GlucoStatusFX acceptable low means values between min normal and min acceptable values).

<b>"Acceptable high value notification":</b><br>
Enable the switch if you would like to receive notifications for acceptable high values (in GlucoStatusFX acceptable high means values between max normal and max acceptable values).

<b>"High value notification":</b><br>
Enable the switch if you would like to receive notifications for high values (in GlucoStatusFX high means values between max acceptable and 350 mg/dl which is max critical).
